# Agricultural-Management-System
This is a demo web-app that is based on the agricultural prospect of Bangladesh.
All the files are here. Just extract the "Pages.rar" and the folder name should be "Pages". And keep the other files in the folder (e.g I kept them in "htdocs"). Use the sql file to set up your database.


In short, 
1. Install xampp.
2. Open xampp from control panel. Click 'Start' to 'Apache' and 'Mysql'.
3. Click 'Admin' in 'Mysql'.(It'll take you into a browser and open the 'localhost')
4. Create a database and name it 'agriculture'.
5. Select the database named 'agriculture', then import the 'sql' file. Now, the database is set.
6. There will be a folder called 'htdocs' under the folder named 'xampp' in 'C drive'.
7. Extract the file named 'Pages'.
8. Move the "Pages" forlder and all other files into 'htdocs'.'Main.html' is your homepage.


NB:The project report contains some snaps of the web-app that won't match as I changed the styling of the web-app afterwards.
