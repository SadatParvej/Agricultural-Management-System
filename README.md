# Agricultural-Management-System
This is a demo web-app that is based on the agricultural prospect of Bangladesh.
All the files are here. Just extract the "Pages.rar" and the folder name should be "Pages". And keep the other files in the folder (e.g I kept them in "htdocs"). Use the sql file to set up your database.


In short, Move the "Pages" forlder and all other files into a folder, set up your database and you're good to go.'Main' is your homepage.

NB:The project report contains some snaps of the web-app that won't match as I changed the styling of the web-app afterwards.
